### Hi there! 👋

> The User Management API is designed to provide robust user authentication and management functionalities. This API enables users to perform essential operations such as registration, login, password recovery, etc. Additionally, it includes an admin-only CRUD for managing user accounts.
>
> The primary goal of this project was to enhance backend development skills by implementing a comprehensive user management system. This includes sophisticated authentication mechanisms and administrative capabilities to manage users effectively. The combination of NestJS, Docker, Prisma and PostgreSQL ensures a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution.
>
> Also there is a branch using TypeORM instead of Prisma, just for learning purposes. you can check it out [here](https://github.com/arthurlbo/user-management-api/tree/type-orm).
